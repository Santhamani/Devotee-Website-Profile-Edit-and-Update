        <p>Mysore is yet to, and perhaps will never, get over its past.
         A past thatâ€™s made of kings, queens, conquests, rich patrons, 
         extravagant durbars and pearled hallways must be hard to get over.
         The streets in Mysore are old and a good part of history can be traced 
         by following their winding paths. The city that gets its name from Mahishasura, 
         the troublemaker demon who was slain by the Goddess Chamundeshwari: whose 
         temple atop the Chamundi Hill watches all over the city has played host to 
         the reign of a long line of Wadiyars, Tipu Sultan and the British Raj.</p>
